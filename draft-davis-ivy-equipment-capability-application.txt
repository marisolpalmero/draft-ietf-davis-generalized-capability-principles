                    Equipment Capability Application
            draft-davis-ivy-equipment-capability-application

Abstract

   This document applies the generalized capability principles to the
   description of physical equipment and shows how such capability
   specifications integrate with base inventory and entitlement models
   as defined in [BaseInventory] and [EntitlementInventory].

   The approcah is expmained by example, focusing on how the potential
   capabilities of equipment types are described, how these map to
   entitlements (licensed or policy-controlled subsets of capabilities),
   and how they are instantiated as inventory items.  The explanation
   covers both physical capabilities and emergent functionality.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT"
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119}}.

   The following terms abbreviations are used in this document:

   *  equipment: A physical item necessary for a particular purpose.

   *  physical: Has spatial dimensions (i.e., can be measured with a
      "ruler") and in some cases has mass (i.e., can be weighed with
      scales)

   *  SFP: Small Form-factor Pluggable

2.  Introduction

   Physical items have various fundamental properties such as length,
   temperature, weight.  In an assembly of phsyical things each thing
   plays various roles in the structure and has to be compatible with
   the other things in that structure so that it can participate in
   those roles.

   In a telecoms environment, there are many physical things that
   support the provision of service.  For simplicity, in this document a
   physical thing that is useful for the provision of telecommunication
   service will be refered to as an equipment.  The focus of this
   document is limited to telecommunications networks and hence
   equipments for related purposes, but there is no specific limitation
   to the method that prevent it from being applied more broadly.  This
   restriction is simply to reduce the volume and complexity of the
   descriptions.

   The equipments to be represented include boards (circuit packs) and
   shelves (subracks).  In this description an SFP will be considered as
   a board.  The essential structural model is that a shelf can be
   placed in a rack, a board in a slot in a shelf and a board (SFP) in a
   slot in a board.

   Whilst this general model says a board can be placed in a slot,
   clearly not all boards can be placed in all slots.  This document
   describes the opportunities in terms of physical capabilities of
   types of physical things where a type of thing is a set of tings
   having common characteristics such that all relevant characteristics
   are the same such that the things can be interchangeable.

   // <<<IDEA is to include another example, that could cover software/
   virtual.  Need more discussions. >>>

   This document is part of a suite that includes:

   *  [GenCapPrin] — defines the generalized capability and refinement
      principles.

   *  [BaseInventory] — defines how equipment occurrences are
      represented in a network inventory.

   *  [EntitlementInventory] — defines how capability entitlements and
      licensed functionality are tracked.

   Together, these drafts describe a continuous trace:

   Capability → Entitlement → Inventory → Realization

   Figure 1: Relationship between Capability, Entitlement, and Inventory

   where:

   *  *Capability* defines what an equipment _can_ do (its potential);

   *  *Entitlement* defines what an operator _is allowed_ or _enabled_
      to use; and

   *  *Inventory* records what _actually exists_ and is deployed.

   The goal of this draft is to show, by concrete examples, how the
   generalized capability framework is specialized for equipment and how
   that structure integrates with inventory and entitlement data.

   Whilst this general model says a board can be placed in a slot,
   clearly not all boards can be placed in all slots.  This document
   describes the opportunities in terms of physical capabilities of
   types of physical things.

   A majority of powered physical things can be configured and can have
   their behaviour define in code and data.  The capability, in these
   cases, is emergent from the combination of the physical structure
   activated by power and shaped by data and code.  Hence the overall
   capability specification may be defined by a complex combination of
   capability specifications.

   Hence, an inserted board supports functionality.  Some functions
   emerge from a combination of boards.  The specification method
   described here allows the functions that emerge from assemblies of
   equipment to be described in detail.

   The specification of potential emergemt functions can be used at
   various stagest of the network lifecycle.  The specification of
   emergemt functions allows a purchasing application to determine which
   particular types of hardware can be acquired and a planning tool to
   determine how to arrange occurrences of types of hardware in systems
   to support particular functions pior to the purchase of any
   equipment.

3.  Problem Statement

   A telecoms network is realized through an assembly of equipments
   (such as curcuit packs, boards, racks, cables etc.), some passive
   (not directly powered), some active (directly powered) and some
   running complex software etc.  Each assembly provides some capability
   that supports the provision of service.  Understanding these
   capabilities in detail and precisely is vital throughout the life of
   the network.

   Whilst an active equipment may provide an interface that exposes what
   is available currently, it rarely indicates what is potentially
   avaliable and when it does this is usually through an ad-hoc
   mechanism which only conveys a limited view of capability.  Clearly,
   when the equipment is not powered, it is not possible to interrogate
   it even for this sparse and basic information.  Passive equipments
   cannot be interrogated.

   Manufactures of equipments produce types of equipment where each
   instance of that type is essentially identical with respect to
   capabilities within an acceptable and understood tolerance.  Any
   instance of a type of equipment is interchangeable with another
   instance of the same type.  There may also be other compatibilities
   where different types have the same or a superset capability and
   hence can be used as alternatives.

   In practice, managing equipment capabilities in isolation is
   insufficient.  Each capability must be tied to:

   *  an _entitlement_ indicating whether it is licensed or permitted
      for use, and

   *  an _inventory record_ that anchors the capability to a deployed
      occurrence.

   This tri-layer relationship enables operators to reason about what
   equipment types exist, what functions they can theoretically perform,
   what has been purchased or activated, and what is currently deployed
   or configured.

   Without such linkage, automation frameworks cannot determine whether
   a planned configuration is feasible, legally licensed, or available
   in the installed base.

   Whilst an active equipment may provide an interface that exposes what
   is available currently, it rarely indicates what is potentially
   avaliable and when it does this is usually through an ad-hoc
   mechanism.  Clearly, when the active equipment is not powered, it is
   not possible to interrogate it even for this sparse and basic
   information.  Passive equipments cannot be interrogated.

   Manufactures of equipments produce types of equipment where each
   instance of that type is essentially identical with respect to
   capabilities within an acceptable and understood tolerance.  Any
   instance of a type of equipment is interchangeable with an instance
   of the same type.  There may also be other compatibilities where
   different types have the same or a superset capability and hence can
   be used as alternatives.

   It is necessary to understand some aspects of capability of a type of
   equipment at all stages of the lifecycle: - whilst speculation about
   services to be provided prior to network design and researching
   potential network capabilities - when planning network structure -
   prior to purchasing, when choosing particular equipment types for a
   specific purpose where there are alternatives - when planning future
   deployment of equipments - when the equipment is installed and
   services are being designed - even when the equipment is fully
   configured and operational with no errors etc., there may be
   heartbeat and status capabilities

   Considering the above, it is necessary to have a complete description
   of capability that is available independent of the presence of
   equipment.  This description needs to be rigorous and readily
   interpretable allowing for comparisons with other equipment types
   etc.  On that basis the capabilities should be described in a
   normalized language where advantage is taken of recurring patterns
   etc.

   As automation progresses, machine interpretability of the capability
   information becomes increasingly important.  Whilst AI, especially
   LLMs, can deal with the variety of human interaction, a more
   efficient and compact language usage is preferable for efficiency and
   removal of potential ambiguity.

   This document sets out an approach for expression of capabilities of
   equipment in terms of physical structure, software/data structure and
   emergent functionality.

   Whilst knowing the YANG model for the equipment is beneficial, it is
   not sufficient.  The YANG model essentially provides a space within
   which actual state and configuration can be expresses.  The YANG
   model tends to not express equipment type based constraints.  Whilst
   specifying the commbinatorial effects of interacting equipments and
   software in YANG is potentially possible, the mechanisms availble are
   not designed for this purpose and the results would probably be a
   large set of special models with extremely cumbersome/complex
   definitions that would be distinct from the interface model that is
   necessarily open and broad.

4.  Specification in terms of the Model

   The specification of equipment capability should be presented in
   terms of the _generalized capability model_ from [GenCapPrin] and
   explicitly mapped to the inventory and entitlement contexts.

   The relationships between these elements can be summarized as:

    +=============+========================+==========================+
    | Concept     | Defined In             | Represents               |
    +=============+========================+==========================+
    | Capability  | [GenCapPrin], this     | The potential functions  |
    | Spec        | draft                  | and limits of an         |
    |             |                        | equipment type           |
    +-------------+------------------------+--------------------------+
    | Entitlement | [EntitlementInventory] | The subset of            |
    |             |                        | capabilities permitted   |
    |             |                        | or licensed              |
    +-------------+------------------------+--------------------------+
    | Inventory   | [BaseInventory]        | The actual occurrence of |
    | Item        |                        | an entitled capability   |
    |             |                        | in the network           |
    +-------------+------------------------+--------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This linkage ensures that refinement and occurrence formation have a
   tangible operational anchor in network management systems.

5.  Some specification examples

   This section illustrates how equipment capability specifications
   connect to entitlement and inventory concepts.

   Example — Optical Transponder:

   1.  *Generic capability*: an abstract optical transponder supporting
       multiple modulation formats up to 800 G.

   2.  *Equipment capability specification*: a vendor-specific model
       constrained to 400 G operation, defining port, thermal, and power
       envelopes.

   3.  *Entitlement*: a software license enabling the 400 G feature set;
       represented via the entitlement model.

   4.  *Inventory occurrence*: a deployed device instance that has the
       entitlement applied and exposes its active capabilities through
       inventory records.

   This recursive narrowing from generic capability to entitled
   occurrence demonstrates how specification refinement is operationally
   realized.

   Note that the use of the physical and functional considerations are
   recursively intertwined... a bit of physical, emergent function,
   function assembly, physical assembly thermals etc.

   Start with a generalized equipment and a generalized function and
   sketch the narrowing.

   A physical equipment in a physical context considering how it fits
   and what fits in it... -type -size -thermals -power/thermal -physical
   compatibility -electrical compatibility -diagram or compatibilities
   from ONF work -physical assemblies and thermals

   Function emergent from a physical equipment -raw functions (use
   ProcessingConstruct recursion as per ONF) -emergent capabilities and
   needs -functional compatibility -power and thermals per functions A
   system of equipments in an assembly -functional assemblies -power and
   thermals per assembly A system arrangements for a protection scheme.
   A specification for a system arrangement for a service and associated
   realization pattern specifications.

6.  Recursive narrowing

   This general principle is considered in the context of equipment
   specification.

7.  Specification of an assembly

   Highlighting this general principle in terms of assemblies of
   physical things and the emergent behaviour that results.

8.  Generalization of the specification

   Showing the reuse of specicifation fragments.

9.  Using the language of specification

   This requires work in the generalized capabilities draft.

10.  Building the equipment specification structure

   Take the language and general structure and build specific equipment.

11.  Conclusion

   This document applies the generalized capability principles to the
   specific case of equipment.  By linking equipment capability
   descriptions to entitlements and inventory items, it creates a
   complete semantic chain from potential → permitted → realized.

   This alignment ensures that planning, procurement, licensing, and
   operational systems can reason coherently about equipment functions
   and their lifecycle.  The approach enables automation, energy- and
   sustainability-aware network management, and AI-assisted reasoning
   grounded in formally defined capability structures.

Appendix A.  Appendix A: Interpretive Notes on Refinement and Occurrence

A.1.  A.1 No Single Refinement Path

   In this modeling approach, there is no single correct way to refine a
   universal component.  The refinement process supports multiple valid
   paths, each representing a different semantic purpose, level of
   granularity, or domain context.  What emerges depends not on a fixed
   taxonomy, but on the alignment of constraints, intent, and reuse
   patterns.

   This enables: - Coexistence of multiple specification layers derived
   from the same abstract element, - Domain-specific “semantic phases”
   that are meaningful within a particular stack (e.g., optical vs
   packet), - Purpose-driven modeling: e.g., one path for plug
   manifests, another for logical topology.

A.2.  A.2 Occurrence at Every Layer

   Occurrences are not limited to final instances.  Each meaningful
   stage of refinement produces an occurrence—an intent-aligned,
   constrained projection of the universal component.  Even so-called
   “instances” are not full realizations, but expressed intent within a
   given operational context.

A.3.  A.3 Sweating Out the Shape

   Useful structural forms (e.g., an LTP) are not pre-classified
   primitives.  They _emerge_ from the pruning process when remaining
   capabilities reach a “sweat spot” of balance—enough constraints to be
   meaningful, but not so much as to be frozen.  This allows the model
   to remain adaptive while still supporting mapping, reasoning, and
   automation.

A.4.  A.4 Classification Considered Harmful

   Rigid classification schemes tend to obscure natural emergence and
   lead to artificial separations.  This model rejects top-down typing
   in favor of bottom-up capability surfacing, grounded in refinement
   logic.  Semantic rigor replaces taxonomic rigidity.
